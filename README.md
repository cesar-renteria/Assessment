# .NET Assessment

This assessment is designed to test your familiarity of the .NET Core framework and its particularities. You will have 30 minutes to complete it. It is not necessary that you finish it, only that you display familiarity with the project environment and are able to problem solve. It is fine to look things up, but communicate what you are looking up and why.

## What we&apos;re looking for

- **Production Quality Code:** submitted code should be ready to ship to production and not require additional refactoring. It will be judged in the state that it is submitted in.

- **Well Organized Code:** be thoughtful with how you organize your project and code. Consider code reuse and the size of functions and components.

- **Secure Code:** security is extremely important, there should be no glaring security issues in your code.

## Tasks

The weather app isn&apos;t quite done. Get it to a production-ready state.

- Center the app&apos;s information view.
- The city&apos;s registered low temperature is not rendering at all. Determine why and fix it.
- The user wants wind speed to be displayed below humidity, along with its unit of measurement.
- There is currently no error handling for invalid queries. Implement it.

## Security
Is there anything wrong with the way the Open Weather API key is stored? If there is, what changes would you suggest?
